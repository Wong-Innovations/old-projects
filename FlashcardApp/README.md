## About The Project

I wanted to create an app to help me study Japanese vocabulary for when I travel there in November 2021. I used react-native to make a cross-platform mobile app combining the abitily to add custom flashcards with features langauge learning apps use to optimize study time. Cards can be reviewed using multiple choice answer or text input, and cards which the user answers incorrectly are shown more frequently.
