## First-Time Setup

Create an empty directory and then the following sequence of commands inside:

```console
foo@bar:~$ git init

foo@bar:~$ git remote add origin https://github.com/Wong-Innovations/citation-generator

foo@bar:~$ git pull origin master

foo@bar:~$ npm i -S react react-dom react-scripts redux react-redux draft-js draft-js-import-html @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons cross-spawn google-books-search
```

## Running the development server

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
